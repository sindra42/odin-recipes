            <p>
                This light and fluffy dessert is a treat that my family would make during the summer. It's an easy no-bake that is sure to be a crowd pleaser at any BBQ or big get together.

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Angel food cake (store bought)</li>
                    <li>Strawberry Jell-O</li>
                    <li>Boiling water</li>
                    <li>frozen whipped topping (such as cool whip thawed in fridge)</li>
                    <li>frozen strawberries in sugar (the kind that comes with juice, not whole berries), straight from the freezer</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Remove the strawberries from the freezer (if frozen) and let them sit on the counter while working through the next steps.</li>
                    <li>Crumble up the cake and add half of the pieces to the bottom of a dish.</li>
                    <li>Mix Jell-O in a bowl with 2 cups boiling water. Stir well to dissolve the jello powder.</li>
                    <li>Add strawberries immediately and stir. Frozen strawberries work best as the cold helps the jello to set.</li>
                    <li>Stirring helps to melt the strawberry juice, but if the juice sticks in clumps you may need to use your hands to break them.</li>
                    <li>Fold in spoonfuls of cool whip until well mixed.</li>
                    <li>You should take the cool whip out of the freezer to thaw first, but if not it will still work.</li>
                    <li>Spoon 1/2 of mixture over the first half of angel food cake in dish.</li>
                    <li>Repeat with a second layer of angel food cake and the rest of the mixture.</li>
                    <li>Make sure all pieces are submerged in the mixture to soak up the sweet creamy goodness.</li>
                    <li>Cover then set in refrigerator for several hours.</li>
                    <li>The longer it sets the more it will keep shape when being served, but you can just spoon it into bowls. Congrats on your pink monstrosity!</li>
                </ol>
